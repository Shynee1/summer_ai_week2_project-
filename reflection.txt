I thought this project was relatively simple. 
Implementing the basic search algorithm was very easy, and I was able to transfer it to all of the specific algorithms. 
One challenge I faced was interpreting the output of the built-in pacman functions.
I solved this issue by reading the project description and printing the various outputs.
For the A* search, I used a heuristic that calculated the geometric distance from the current position to the end goal.
This calculation was performed using the euclidean distance formula and was very efficient.
